# Coupon and Product App (Learning Project)

A small **Java** demo to practice core concepts: creating/searching coupons, applying them to products, and persisting basic product data.  
This project was built for **learning purposes** — not for real-world use.

---

## Why this project exists
I built this to understand fundamentals like:
- Basic CRUD flows (coupons, products)
- Applying business rules (price adjustment with a coupon)
- Separating simple layers (model → service → persistence)
- Handling basic user input and validation

---

## What it does (demo scope)
- Create coupons
- Search/find coupons
- Create products and optionally apply a coupon
- Store product details in a simple data store

> **Note:** This is intentionally minimal. Error handling, security, validation, and production concerns are limited or omitted.

## Tech Used
- **Advanced Java** (practice focus)
- **HTML** (basic UI)
